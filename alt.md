# Advanced SSD Benchmarking Program

## Overview
This Python script provides an advanced benchmarking suite for testing SSD performance, incorporating multithreading, different I/O patterns, and detailed statistical analysis. It allows users to select drives, specify test parameters, and measure performance under various conditions.

## Features

- **Drive Selection**: Users can choose from available drives on their system.
- **Variable Test Parameters**: Input for test file size in MB, number of test cycles, and number of concurrent threads.
- **Benchmarking**:
  - **Sequential Write**: Writing data in one large chunk.
  - **Sequential Read**: Reading the entire file sequentially.
  - **Random Access**: Random reads across the file.
  - **Small Write**: Writing data in smaller 1KB chunks to simulate different I/O scenarios.
- **Multithreading**: Perform benchmarks concurrently to measure performance under multi-tasking scenarios.
- **Detailed Statistics**: For each operation, calculates:
  - Average time
  - Maximum time
  - Minimum time
  - Median time
  - Standard deviation
- **Error Handling**: Extensive error logging and user feedback for troubleshooting.
- **Logging**: Logs all operations to both console and a log file for detailed tracking.
- **Verbose Output**: Provides step-by-step feedback on screen.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `psutil` library (`pip install psutil`)

## Program Structure

### Main Functions

- **`write_file(file_path, size_mb)`**: Writes a binary file of specified size.
- **`read_file(file_path)`**: Reads the entire file to measure read performance.
- **`random_access(file_path, size_mb)`**: Performs random read operations on the file.
- **`small_write(file_path)`**: Writes data in small chunks to simulate frequent small writes.
- **`perform_benchmark(operation, file_path, size_mb, results)`**: Runs a specific benchmark operation in a thread.
- **`benchmark(test_file, size_mb, cycles, threads)`**: Orchestrates the benchmarking process across cycles and threads, collecting results.
- **`get_available_drives()`**: Lists mount points of writable drives.
- **`main()`**: Orchestrates the program flow, including user interaction.

### Error Handling and Logging
- **Logging Setup**: Uses Python's `logging` module to log to both console and file (`ssd_benchmark_advanced.log`).
- **Error Catching**: Each function has try-except blocks to handle specific exceptions like `IOError` for file operations.

### User Interaction
- **Drive Selection**: Users choose from a list of drives.
- **Input for Test Parameters**: Users specify file size, cycle count, and thread count.

## Usage

1. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python ssd_benchmark_advanced.py
   ```

Select a drive from the listed options.
Input test parameters:
File size in MB
Number of test cycles
Number of concurrent threads

The script will then perform the benchmarks and display detailed results on the screen while also logging them.

Example Output:
```bash
Available drives:
  1. /mnt/sda1
  2. /mnt/sdb1
Select drive by number: 2
Selected drive: /mnt/sdb1
Enter test file size in MB: 100
Enter number of test cycles: 5
Enter number of concurrent threads (e.g., 4): 4

Benchmark Results:
  Sequential Write:
    - Average: 0.123456 seconds
    - Max: 0.134567 seconds
    - Min: 0.112345 seconds
    - Median: 0.124567 seconds
    - Standard Deviation: 0.008765 seconds
  ...
Test file cleaned up.
```
Limitations
Controlled Environment: For precise benchmarking, ensure no other heavy I/O operations are occurring.
Cache Influence: SSD caching can skew results if not managed or accounted for.
Thread Overhead: Too many threads might introduce overhead, potentially affecting results on less powerful systems.

Enhancements
Workload Simulation: Add more realistic workloads that simulate actual application behavior.
Temperature Monitoring: Include SSD temperature monitoring to assess thermal performance impact.
Benchmark Variations: Experiment with different block sizes for read/write operations.

Conclusion
This script offers a robust framework for understanding SSD performance under various conditions and I/O patterns. 
It's particularly useful for educational purposes, initial performance checks, or when needing to compare different 
SSDs in a controlled environment. However, for professional benchmarking, consider using specialized tools like fio 
for more nuanced and accurate results.
